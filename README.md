# RSSMerge

RSSMerge is a simple API that takes the of a list of feeds in plain text and
returns an interleaved feed.

This was created for use with IFTTT's weekly RSS digests.

This site was originally implemented as a lambda function but I'm trying to run
all of my side projects on Kubernetes so it now runs on my personal cluster
instead.
